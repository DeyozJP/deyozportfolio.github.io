                                    <p>Predicting customer churn enable us to analyze deeper into the variable causing customer to churn, that inturn helps us in formulating strategy to increase customer retentions. We developed classifier models: decision tree, naive bayes, xg-boost and deep learning neural networks models using historical data to predict banking customers' churn. Based on the performace metrices, XG boost performed better with abount 80 percent accuracy and precision. We also grouped customers into several bivariate clusters, using k-means clustering, which we used to analyze the profile of churning and non-churning customers. We found that churn rate is very high in customers of age above 35, which is a serious concern.</p>

We analyzed distributions of air particulate matter by different geographical locations such as countries and cities to understand the places with the most and least pollutants and to know how those pollutants have changed over time. From these dashboards, users can find answers to the questions such as Which regions, countries, or cities that are least and most polluted by particulate matter type (PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO2)? Which countries have done well or poorly (direction and magnitude) over the past years in controlling pollution? There are more dashboards that contain many interesting data visualizations. </p>

                                    <p>In this project, we used 14 days of mobile ad data, available in Kaggle, to develop and evaluate models that predict whether ads shown to the user will click or not, eventually determining CTR. The main feature of this project is to show how to transform the categorical variables that have many values to make one-hot encoding an inappropriate method of transformation. Another highlight of this project is how to determine the optimum threshold for classification and present the trade-offs between recall and precision. Also, model evaluation techniques such as Receiver Operating Curve, Area Under the Curve, Cumulative Gain Curve, and Lift Curve are applied to evaluate the model performance. </p>
                                    <p>We used Gradient Boost, XG Boost, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest. Based on the ROC and AUC, Gradient Boost and XG Boost outperformed other models. Based on the resource requirements, we selected XG Boost. However, the recall rate, which is an important metric in this use case, was low initially. We increased the recall rate to 87 percent by reducing the threshold to 0.15 for classification, which reduced the precision rate to 33 percent.  </p>
                                    <p>We further evaluated the model using cumulative gain chart and lift curve, which shows that selecting the top 20 % of the leads ranked as most likely to respond to an ad will contain about 55% of the actual click. The expected baseline number without using the model would only be 20%. Therefore, the model adds business value. </p>

                                    <p>In this project, I used Python libraries to build an ARIMA model to predict the Meta’s stock price for 26 days. From the daily close price (time series) of Meta’s past two years’ data, a signal is captured for prediction. The model looked very promising as it not just captured the trend but also the variations, hence this model can be applied to predict Meta’s stock price for the short-term </p>
